```html
<button class="button">Hello confront!</button>
```

---

<Appear>
  <SimpleButton>Hello confront!</SimpleButton>
  <div><br /> 0 lines of code in CSS</div>
</Appear>

```notes
This is the simplest button possible.
Does anyone have an idea how many LOC in CSS it took to style it.
Yup 0 LOC. This is the basic chrome rendered button on OSX!
```

---

<Appear>
  <GreenElpButton>Hello confront!</GreenElpButton>
  <div><br /> 35 lines of code in SASS</div>
</Appear>

```notes
Next example:
Custom color, font, hover, active, DISABLED, radius.
Does anyone have an idea how many LOC in CSS it took to style it.
35 lines of SASS around 40 lines of CSS.
Let's look at the code.
```

<CodeSurfer
  code={elpButtonSnippet}
  lang="scss"
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [3, 7], notes: "Box Properties" },
    { range: [9, 9], notes: "Background" },
    { range: [11, 18], notes: "Text" },
    { range: [19, 20], notes: "Extra properties" },
    { range: [21, 22], notes: "Animations" },
    { range: [23, 34], notes: "States" },
    {},
  ]}
/>

```notes
The amount of code grows drastically whenever you try to implement anything. even the simplest stuff.
35 lines of code gave us a pretty button. Seems like a lot but considering this button is doing so much I would say it was worth it.
```

---

<Appear>
  <RedElpButton>Hello confront!</RedElpButton>
  <div><br /> 35 lines of code in SASS</div>
</Appear>

```notes
This time we have a button with different colors! The simplest way to implement it is obviously to copy all the code but just change the colors.
How many lines of code it might take in that situation then?
35 LOC!
```

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={invertedElpButtonSnippet}
  lang="scss"
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    {},
    { tokens: { 9: [3] } },
    { tokens: { 24: [3] } },
    { tokens: { 28: [3] } },
    {},
  ]}
/>


```notes
In our code we added a second class that consists of the definition of secondary-button which differs only by few properties.
I feel like I could work with this code and not be angry at all.
70 LOC overall. Everything is working beautifully! Let's continue!
```

---

<Appear>
  <BlueElpButton>Hello confront!</BlueElpButton>
  <div><br /> 35 lines of code in SASS</div>
</Appear>

```notes
sigh...
I hate those designers! Third button on 1 page... What can we do?
Another 35 LOC!
```

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={blueElpButtonSnippet}
  lang="scss"
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    {},
    { tokens: { 9: [3] } },
    { tokens: { 24: [3] } },
    { tokens: { 28: [3] } },
    {},
  ]}
/>


```notes
Same mechanism as previously. 
```

---

<div>
  <GreenElpButton>Hello confront!</GreenElpButton>
  <RedElpButton>Hello confront!</RedElpButton>
  <BlueElpButton>Hello confront!</BlueElpButton>
</div>
<br/>
105 LOC

<CodeSurfer
  code={elpButtonSnippet + invertedElpButtonSnippet + blueElpButtonSnippet}
  lang="scss"
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [0, 35], notes: "Green" },
    { range: [35, 70], notes: "Red" },
    { range: [70, 105], notes: "Blue" },
    {},
  ]}
/>

```notes
In our code we added a third class that consists of the definition of third-button which differs only by few properties.
Being a programmer for many years I think I found a pattern.
```

<Image src='done.png' size="contain" />

```notes
Obviously something tells us that this is not a perfect solution, but what is so bad about it?
Is it too long? Is it too complicated? The code still does simple things.
After all people have fast internet currently and we can easily work with 100 lines of code right? Besides GZIP will handle this perfectly.
There is no chance I did something wrong here.
There are no overrides of styles. No !important.
I know that if something changes in design I would need to change it in 3 places. I’ve got find and replace for that.
I think that if someone wrote a commit like this for an app that has 3 only buttons and I did the CR for it I would accept it.
```

New design comes in!

<GreenElpButton>Hello confront!</GreenElpButton>
<GreenElpButton radius>Hello confront!</GreenElpButton>

```notes
Green button with a 
Welp. How do we handle this problem? Exactly the same way we did previously!
```

  lang="scss"
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    {},
    { tokens: { 6: [4, 5] } },

```notes
Everything still works correctly. Another 35 LOC. 140
```

<GreenElpButton>Hello confront!</GreenElpButton>
<GreenElpButton radius>Hello confront!</GreenElpButton>
<br/>
<RedElpButton>Hello confront!</RedElpButton>
<RedElpButton radius>Hello confront!</RedElpButton>
<br/>
<BlueElpButton>Hello confront!</BlueElpButton>
<BlueElpButton radius>Hello confront!</BlueElpButton>
<br/>
<br/>
210 LOC

```notes
The design grows so that it needs other rounded buttons. 210 LOC.
My eyes see that everything is working. I like this style of coding.
I didn't see this approach anywhere on the internet! Why does noone suggest to write CSS like this? 
I will call it DUMBCSS.

The thing is we are not programming.
And now all the backend developers smiled because CSS is not programming!
So what is programming?

In it's first chapter it defines programming as: .
I didn't build any abstractions in my code.

```notes
Let's start building abstractions!
```

<CodeSurfer
  code={abstractButton}
  lang="scss"
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [6, 6], notes: "Radius" },
    { range: [37, 39], notes: "<button class=\"button radius-big\">Hello confront!</button>" },
    { range: [41, 43], notes: "<button class=\"button radius-small\">Hello confront!</button>" },
    {},
  ]}
/>

```notes
The first abstraction we will be building is creating the radius classes.
    { range: [9, 9], notes: "Background" },
    { range: [28, 34], notes: "States" },
```
