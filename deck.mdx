```html
<button class="button">Hello confront!</button>
```

<Appear>
  <SimpleButton>Hello confront!</SimpleButton>
  <div><br /> 0 lines of code in CSS</div>
</Appear>

```notes
This is the simplest button possible.
Does anyone have an idea how many LOC in CSS it took to style it.
Yup 0 LOC. This is the basic chrome rendered button on OSX!
```

<Appear>
  <ElpButton>Hello confront!</ElpButton>
  <div><br /> 35 lines of code in SASS</div>
</Appear>

```notes
Next example:
Custom color, font, hover, active, DISABLED, radius.
Does anyone have an idea how many LOC in CSS it took to style it.
35 lines of SASS around 40 lines of CSS.
Let's look at the code.
```

<CodeSurfer
  code={elpButtonSnippet}
  lang="scss"
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [3, 7], notes: "Box Properties" },
    { range: [9, 9], notes: "Background" },
    { range: [11, 18], notes: "Text" },
    { range: [19, 20], notes: "Extra properties" },
    { range: [21, 22], notes: "Animations" },
    { range: [23, 34], notes: "States" },
    {},
  ]}
/>

```notes
The amount of code grows drastically whenever you try to implement anything. even the simplest stuff.
35 lines of code gave us a pretty button. Seems like a lot but considering this button is doing so much I would say it was worth it.
```

<Appear>
  <InvertedElpButton>Hello confront!</InvertedElpButton>
  <div><br /> 35 lines of code in SASS</div>
</Appear>

```notes
This time we have a button with different colors! The simplest way to implement it is obviously to copy all the code but just change the colors.
How many lines of code it might take in that situation then?
35 LOC!
```

<CodeSurfer
  code={invertedElpButtonSnippet}
  lang="scss"
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    {},
    { tokens: { 9: [3] } },
    { tokens: { 24: [3] } },
    { tokens: { 28: [3] } },
    {},
  ]}
/>


```notes
In our code we added a second class that consists of the definition of secondary-button which differs only by few properties.
I feel like I could work with this code and not be angry at all.
70 LOC overall. Everything is working beautifully! Let's continue!
```

<Appear>
  <BlueElpButton>Hello confront!</BlueElpButton>
  <div><br /> 35 lines of code in SASS</div>
</Appear>

```notes
sigh...
I hate those designers! Third button on 1 page... What can we do?
Another 35 LOC!
```

<CodeSurfer
  code={blueElpButtonSnippet}
  lang="scss"
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    {},
    { tokens: { 9: [3] } },
    { tokens: { 24: [3] } },
    { tokens: { 28: [3] } },
    {},
  ]}
/>


```notes
In our code we added a third class that consists of the definition of third-button which differs only by few properties.
Being a programmer for many years I think I found a pattern.
Obviously something tells us that this is not a perfect solution, but what is so bad about it?
Is it too long? Is it too complicated? The code still does simple things.
